# Introduction #

## Basic Info ##
Hello, everyone! :relaxed: My name is **Rebeka** (English version: Rebecca), I am 20 years old and was born on 18<sup>th</sup> February. Originally, the doctors told my parents I was going to be a boy and so they had the name Jakub (English version: Jacob) chosen for me according to a children’s fairy tale. However, when I turned out to be a girl my mother chose the name Rebeka because she read it in a book and thought it was a pretty name. I finally read the book I am named after last year. :heartbeat:

## Family ##
I have a mother called Miroslava, a father called Dušan and an older brother who is currently 25, his name is Matej (English version: Matthew) and he is working in Zürich in the finance sector. Originally, I come **from the capital of Slovakia - Bratislava** but when I was one year old my family moved to Shanghai, China for three years because of my dad’s work. After that we lived in St. Petersburg, Russia for another three years. In both of these cities I attended international kindergartens/pre-schools. :school satchel:

## Education ##
When it was time for me to start my formal education we moved back to Bratislava, Slovakia. There I went to a school called **Spojená škola Novohradská** for 13 years of my life: it was my primary school, middle school and high school. Since my parents considered it a waste for me to not expand on the foundations of English that I gathered abroad, I undertook an international study programme taught in English called the International Baccalaureate and went through all of its stages from the Primary Years Programme through the Middle Years all the way to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Sadly, the end of my studies was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. :mask:

### University ###
After graduating from high school, I moved to London, United Kingdom and started studying at the **London School of Economics** in September 2020.  I come from Slovakia. Currently, I am in my second year of studying BSc Psychological and Behavioural Science. While it has been rocky due to the on-going pandemic it has also provided me with a lot of exciting experiences and gave me the chance to meet many interesting people from around the globe. Therefore, I am thankful for the opportunity to study there. :sparkles:
